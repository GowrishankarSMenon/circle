# Blockchain-Based Carbon Credit and Waste Recycling Ecosystem

## Introduction

This system envisions a sustainable ecosystem where governments allocate carbon credits to companies based on their emissions. Companies can increase their carbon credits by purchasing recyclable waste from the public and recycling it. Both individuals who provide waste and delivery agents who facilitate its collection are rewarded with cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum). Additionally, companies with surplus carbon credits can trade or sell them to other companies that need more credits.

Our software aims to **automate this entire process**, providing a smooth and transparent transition between government regulations, public participation, company recycling, and carbon credit trading. The goal is to minimize manual intervention, increase trust, and improve efficiency using blockchain and smart contract technologies.

## System Components

### 1. Government Carbon Credit Allocation

- Governments issue carbon points (carbon credits) to companies according to industry standards, size, and emission levels.
- These credits regulate how much carbon a company is allowed to emit.
- The goal is to motivate companies to maintain or reduce their carbon footprint.

### 2. Public Participation in Recycling

- **Individuals** collect recyclable waste and sell it to companies.
- **Delivery agents** pick up the waste from individuals and transport it to companies.
- Both parties earn cryptocurrency rewards (e.g., ETH tokens) as incentives.
- This promotes a circular economy by engaging the community in sustainability efforts.

### 3. Company Recycling and Credit Enhancement

- Companies recycle the collected waste.
- Successful recycling activities increase the companyâ€™s carbon credit balance.
- This mechanism encourages companies to invest in waste management and eco-friendly practices.

### 4. Carbon Credit Trading Marketplace

- Companies with surplus carbon credits can sell or trade them to companies exceeding their emission limits.
- Trading is transparent, secure, and recorded on a blockchain ledger.
- This creates a dynamic marketplace where companies can balance operational needs with sustainability goals.
